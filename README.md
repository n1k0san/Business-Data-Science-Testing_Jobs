This project was finalized following the completion of the first module in our Data Science program and culminated in the creation of a job search platform called JobHunter üîç. Our team engaged in data preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and geoplotting to uncover insights and discern patterns or irregularities within the data.

Following this, we implemented a UML-based recommender system to match individuals with similar jobs using cosine similarity. Additionally, we developed an SML predictive model to forecast the most fitting job sector for a person based on specific attributes.

Overall, this project endowed our team with invaluable experience in applying various data science methodologies such as EDA, both unsupervised and supervised machine learning, and data visualization to datasets from the real world. The achievements of this project underscored the practical applicability of these methods in addressing real-life challenges.
